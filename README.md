# 🍦 Ice Cream Revenue Prediction using Linear Regression

A Machine Learning project that predicts ice cream revenue based on temperature using a Linear Regression model. This project demonstrates how regression analysis can be applied to real-world business forecasting.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Ice cream sales are highly dependent on temperature. The objective of this project is to:

- Analyze the relationship between temperature and revenue
- Build a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model performance
- Generate business insights for sales forecasting

---

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Data visualization  
- Linear Regression model implementation  
- Model performance evaluation (R², MAE, MSE)  
- Business interpretation of results  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 📊 Model Performance

- **R² Score** – Explains how well the model fits the data  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – Average difference between predicted and actual values  
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** – Measures overall prediction error  

Lower MAE and MSE values indicate better model accuracy.

---

## 📈 Results

- Strong positive correlation between temperature and revenue  
- High R² score indicating strong predictive performance  
- Model can be used for forecasting summer sales
