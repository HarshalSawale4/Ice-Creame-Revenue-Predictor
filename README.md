📊 Model Performance

R² Score – Measures how well the model explains the variance in revenue.

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – Shows the average prediction error.

MSE (Mean Squared Error) – Penalizes larger errors and evaluates overall performance.

Lower MAE and MSE values indicate better model accuracy.

📈 Results

Strong positive relationship between temperature and revenue.

High R² score indicating good predictive capability.

Useful for forecasting sales during summer or warmer seasons.
